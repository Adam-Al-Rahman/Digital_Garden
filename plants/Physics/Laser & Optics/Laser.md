Meta-Stable is an excited state of an atom or other system with a longer lifetime than the other excited states.

- However, it has a shorter lifetime than the stable ground state.

- Atoms in the meta-stable state remain excited for a considerable time in the order of $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-3}$.

- During meta-stable state, all the parameters associated with state hold stationary values. A large number of excited atoms are accumulated in the meta-stable state.

|Energy Level| Lifetime|Also Called|
|---|---|---|
|Excited State|$10^{-7}$||
|Meta-Stable State|$10^{-6}$ to $10^{-3}$|Upper Lasing Layer|
|Stable State|Longer than any layer|Lower Lasing Layer|




## Facts to Remember

- Peak power = $\frac{Pulse Energy}{Duration}$
- Power per unit area = $\frac{Peak power}{Area}$

- LASER is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. It is a device to produce an intense, monochromatic, collimated and highly coherent beam of light. The operation of a LASER depends upon the phenomenon of stimulated emission. 
- Population inversion is a necessary criterion for laser action; if 𝑁2 and 𝑁1 are the number of atoms in excited and ground states respectively, then population inversion may be mathematically written as $\frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}} > 1$. If 𝐸2 and 𝐸1 are the energies of the excited and ground states respectively, then $\frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}} = e^{[− (\frac{E_{2}-E_{1}}{K_{b}})]}$, where 𝐾 is the Boltzmann constant. 
- <span style="color:pink">Angular Spread</span>: $𝑑𝜃 = \frac{1.22𝜆}{𝐷}$, 𝜆 is the wavelength and 𝐷 is the diameter of the front mirror. 
- Areal spread = $(f.d\theta)^{2},$ where f is the focal length and 𝑑𝜃 is the angular spread. 
- The ratio of stimulated and spontaneous emissions is given by 𝑆1 = 1 𝑒𝑥𝑝(ℎ𝜈/𝐾𝑇)−1 ; 𝜈 is the frequency of laser light.
- He-Ne laser is a 4 level laser. Atom is the active medium
- Red color light ruby light emit.
- The material which often used in semiconductor laser is the **gallium Arsenide**, therefore semiconductor laser is sometimes known as Gallium Arsenide Laser. It is also called Injection Laser. The semiconductor is made in unique manner for the semiconductor laser.
- The directionality of the LASER beam is measured by beam divergence.
