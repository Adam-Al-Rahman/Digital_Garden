## 1. What is meant by population inversion and how is it achieved in practice?

<span style="color:lightgreen;">$\underline{Sol^{n}}$</span>:

In normal conditions, electron are in lower energy state due to the stability. But, to achieve amplification of light(Stimulated emission) we need to meet the condition, i.e, $N_{2}>N_{1}$, where $N_{2}$ is the number of electron in higher energy and $N_{1}$ is the number of electron in lower(ground) state.

<u>Population Inversion</u>:

The process of achieving greater population of higher energy state as compared to the lower energy state.

<u>Achieved in Practice</u>:

To achieve population inversion, we need to supply energy to the laser medium.

The process of supplying energy to the  laser medium is called `Pumping`.

The source that supplies energy to the laser medium is called `Pump Source`.

The type of pump source used is depends on the laser medium.

Most commonly used pump sources are:

- Optical Pumping
- Electric discharge or excitation by electrons
- Inelastic atom-atom collisions
- Thermal pumping
- Chemical reactions

Population Inversion is achieved through `MetaStable States` an intermediate state, we cannot achieve the condition $N_{2}>N_{1}$ as the lifetime of higher energy level is lower than the meta-stable and ground state.

> Population Inversion is achieved between `MetaStable State` and `Ground State`.
>> Population Inversion cannot be achieved with only two state `Excited State` and `Ground State`

## 2. What is the role of $He$ in $He-Ne$ laser? Explain the working with a suitable energy level diagram.

<span style="color:lightgreen;">$\underline{Sol^{n}}$</span>:

### Role of $He$ atom


- $He$ atom help in exciting neon atoms and cause `Population Inversion`.
- Ratio of $10:1$, 10 helium atom per 1 neon atom. So, energy transfer from helium to neon is more and neon to helium is negligible.
- $Ne$ atom are the `active center`.

### Component of $He-Ne$ laser

- Active Medium: Gas
- Pumping: Electric Discharge.
- Pumping Agent: Electron($e^{-}$).
- Optical Resonator: Fabry-Perot optical resonator.

### Energy Level Diagram of $He-Ne$
![[energy_diagram_of_he-ne.jpg]]

### Working of $He-Ne$ laser

- Helium-Neon laser consists of a long discharge tube filled with a mixture of helium and neon gases in the ratio 10:1. 
- Helium is filled with pressure of $1mm$ of $Hg$.
- Neon is filled with pressure of $0.1mm$ of $Hg$
- A high voltage of about 10kV is applied across the gas mixture. It ionizes the gas.
- The electrons and ions produced in the process of discharge are accelerated towards the anode and cathode respectively. They collide with helium and neon atoms on the way.
- The energetic electron excite the Helium electron, as they are lighter.
- One of the excited levels of helium $F_{2}(2s)$ is at 20.61 eV above the ground level. It is a meta-stable level and the excited helium atom cannot return to the ground level through spontaneous emission.
- However, the excited helium atom can return to the ground level by transferring its excess energy to a neon atom through collision. Such as energy transfer can take place when the two colliding atoms have identical energy levels. Such an energy transfer is knows as `resonant energy transfer`.
- The neon energy level $E_{5}(5s)$ is at $20.66eV$, which is close to the excited energy level $F_{2}$ of helium atom
- Therefore, resonant transfer of energy occurs between the excited helium atom and ground level neon atom.
- The kinetic energy of helium atoms provides the additional $0.05eV$ required for excitation of the neon atoms.
- Helium atoms drop to the ground state after exiting neon atoms.

## 4. Can we have a two-level laser? Explain lasing transition in Ruby laser.

<span style="color:lightgreen;">$\underline{Sol^{n}}$</span>:

No, we cannot have a two-level laser because `population inversion` is not achieved in two-level layer.

#### Lasing transition in Ruby laser

- A chance photon is produced when a $Cr^{3+}$ ion makes a spontaneous transition from $E_{2}$ to $E_{1}$ level.
- This spontaneous photon stimulates another excited ion to make a downward transition.
- This stimulated photon and the initial photon trigger many excited ions to emit photons.
- Red photons of wavelength 6943<span>A&deg;</span> travelling along the axis of the ruby rod are repeatedly reflected at the end mirrors and light amplification takes place.
- On attaining sufficient energy, the laser beam emerges out through the partially reflecting mirror.
- The laser emission occurs in the visible region at a wavelength of 6943<span>A&deg;</span> travelling along the axis of the ruby rod are repeatedly reflected at the end mirrors and light amplification takes places.
- On attaining sufficient energy, the laser beam emerges out through the partially reflecting mirror.
- The laser emission occurs in the visible region at  a wavelength of 6943<span>A&deg;</span>.
- Once stimulated transited transitions commence, the metastable state get depopulated very rapidly and the state of population inversion disappears and lasing action ceases.
- The laser becomes active once again when population inversion state is re-established
- Therefore, the output of the laser is not a continuous wave but occurs in the form or pulses of microsecond duration.

## 5. How could you differentiate between holography and photography?

<span style="color:lightgreen;">$\underline{Sol^{n}}$</span>:

The difference between holography and photography

|Holography|Photography|
|---|---|
|For holography, we only use coherent monochromatic light sources or we can say laser light|For photography, we need an ordinary light source|
|It is a two step lens-less process| We need a lens system for photography|
|Image Resolution is very high|Image Resolution is low|
|Image formed is 3D|Image formed is 2D|
|Phenomenon - Interference and Diffraction|Phenomenon - Reflection and Refraction|
|Image based on both intensity and phase of the wave|Image based on the intensity of the wave.|
|If a hologram is watched at different angle i looks different.|If a photograph, is watched at different angle it looks same|
|In holography, hologram has high information capacity|In photography, photograph has less information capacity|
