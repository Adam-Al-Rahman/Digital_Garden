## 1. What is meant by population inversion and how is it achieved in practice?

<span style="color:lightgreen;">$\underline{Sol^{n}}$</span>:

In normal conditions, electron are in lower energy state due to the stability. But, to achieve amplification of light(Stimulated emission) we need to meet the condition, i.e, $N_{2}>N_{1}$, where $N_{2}$ is the number of electron in higher energy and $N_{1}$ is the number of electron in lower(ground) state.

<u>Population Inversion</u>:

The process of achieving greater population of higher energy state as compared to the lower energy state.

<u>Achieved in Practice</u>:

To achieve population inversion, we need to supply energy to the laser medium.

The process of supplying energy to the  laser medium is called `Pumping`.

The source that supplies energy to the laser medium is called `Pump Source`.

The type of pump source used is depends on the laser medium.

Most commonly used pump sources are:

- Optical Pumping
- Electric discharge or excitation by electrons
- Inelastic atom-atom collisions
- Thermal pumping
- Chemical reactions

Population Inversion is achieved through `MetaStable States` an intermediate state, we cannot achieve the condition $N_{2}>N_{1}$ as the lifetime of higher energy level is lower than the meta-stable and ground state.

> Population Inversion is achieved between `MetaStable State` and `Ground State`.
>> Population Inversion cannot be achieved with only two state `Excited State` and `Ground State`

## 2. What is the role of $He$ in $He-Ne$ laser? Explain the working with a suitable energy level diagram.

### Role of $He$ atom


- $He$ atom help in exciting neon atoms and cause `Population Inversion`.
- Ratio of $10:1$, 10 helium atom per 1 neon atom. So, energy transfer from helium to neon is more and neon to helium is negligible.
- $Ne$ atom are the `active center`.

### Component of $He-Ne$ laser

- Active Medium: Gas()
- Pumping: Electric Discharge.
- Pumping Agent: Electron($e^{-}$).
- Optical Resonator: Fabry-Perot optical resonator.
