## Algorithms & Flowchart

A typical programming task can be divided into two phases:

1. Problem Solving Phase.
	1. Produce an ordered sequence of steps that describe solution of problem.
	2. This sequence of steps is called an `Algorithm`.
2. Implementation Phase.
	1. Implement the program is some programming language.

### Step in Problem Solving

- First produce a general algorithm ( one can use psuedocode)
- Algorithms.

### Definition

- `Algorithm` : It is procedure to solving process step by step.
- `Flowchart` : Visual representation of the process (block by block).
- `Pseudo Code` : English like statement of algorithm.

## Syntax & Semantics

### Syntax

The form or structure of programming language.

- Syntax is defined using rules.
- Specifying how statements, declaration.


### Lexems

 Lexems : Lowest-level syntatic units
 
 |Lexems|Tokens|
 |:--:|:--:|
 |variable_names|identifier|
 |=|Equal-sign|

### Semantics

Meaning of the syntaxs

### Sentence

> Here, `legal` means syntactically correct.

Example

Let us denote,

|Alphabet|Denote to|
|:--:|:--:|
|a|identifier|
|b|string|
|c|(|
|d|)|
|e|;|
|f|{|
|g|}|


```c
int main(){
	printf("Hello World");
}
```

Above c code can be written as

`aacdfacbeg`, if this is correct semantically then it is "Legal".

## Grammar


## Derivation

- Each of the string in the derivation, including <program\>, is called a `Sentential form`

## Parse trees

Hierarchical syntactic structure of the sentence of the language are called `Parse tree`

- Every internal node of a parse tree in labeled with a "Non - terminal symbol".

## Operator Precedence (BODMAS)

> Sentence : A = B + C * A

## Associativity of Operators

## Extended BNF [EBNF]

## Variables

A variable is an abtraction of a memory cell.

> Imperative language are abstraction of `Von Neumann architecture`.

- Key component of Von Neumann.
	- Memory : Store data & Instructions.
	- Processor : Do operations to modify memory contents.

## Binding
### Possible binding times
- Language design times.
- Language implementation times
- Compile time.
- Run time

### Static and Dynamic binding

- Static : Remain un-change through out program execution.
- Dynamic : Can change through program execution.

### Storage binding & Lifetime
