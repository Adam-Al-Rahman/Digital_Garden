#### Trivial & Non-Trivial Solution

The system of equation in which the determinant of the coefficient is zero is called non-trivial solution. And the system of equation in which the determinant of the coefficient matrix is not zero but the solution are x=y=z=0 is called trivial solution. In fact, the trivial solution occur in homogeneous equation in which the constant term is equal to zero.
