## <u>Experiment-1</u> : Linux Commands and C programming Environment

#### <u>Objective</u>: To familiarize Linux Commands and demonstrate a clear understanding of the C-programming environment.

#### <u>Activity</u> : 1. Study of Linux Commands

<h4 style="border: 3px; border-color: #6f6fc8; border-style: dashed; padding:10px;"> 1.a] Working with directories : `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `dir`, `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`.</h4>

**<u>Aim</u>** : Understand the following linux command through implementing it.

**<u>Theory</u>**
- `mkdir` : Create an empty directory in the present directory.
	- Syntax : `mkdir Dir_Name`
- `rmdir` : Remove the named directory.
	- Syntax : `rmdir Dir_Name`
- `dir` : list the contents of a directorylist the contents of a directory
	- **dir** command differs from **ls** command in the format of listing contents that is in default listing options.**dir** command differs from **ls** command in the format of listing contents that is in default listing options.
	- Syntax : `dir [options] [File]`
- `cd` : change the current directory.
	- Syntax : `cd <Dir_Name>`
- `pwd` : Display the location of the current working directory.
	- Syntax : `pwd`
- `ls` : Display a list of content of a directory.
	- Syntax : `ls`

**<u>Commands</u>**


- For `ls` command

- For `mkdir` command

---

- For  `pwd` command

![cd command](../../../assets/images/ppl_lab/pwd_command.png)

---

- For `cd` command

![cd command](../../../assets/images/ppl_lab/cd_command.png)

---

- For `dir` command

By default, **dir** command lists the files and folders in columns, sorted vertically and special characters are represented by backslash escape sequences. But unlike ls, when the output is on terminal, it does not produce colored output as **ls** does.
