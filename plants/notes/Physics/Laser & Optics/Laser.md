Meta-Stable is an excited state of an atom or other system with a longer lifetime than the other excited states.

- However, it has a shorter lifetime than the stable ground state.

- Atoms in the meta-stable state remain excited for a considerable time in the order of $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-3}$.

- During meta-stable state, all the parameters associated with state hold stationary values. A large number of excited atoms are accumulated in the meta-stable state.
