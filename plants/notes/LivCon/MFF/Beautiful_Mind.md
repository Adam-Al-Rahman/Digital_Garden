- A mathematical genius, he made an astonishing discovery early in his career and stood on the brink of international acclaim. 
- But the handsome and arrogant Nash soon found himself on a painful and harrowing journey of self-discovery. 
- After many years of struggle, he eventually triumphed over his tragedy, and finally - late in life - received the Nobel Prize. Universal Pictures and Dream-Works Pictures.
- This is a Beautiful movie of a great genius John Forbes Nash Jr who despite his schizophrenia went on to win a Nobel Prize, powerfully conveys the message that recovery is possible and that “extraordinary things can happen.” 
- While A Beautiful Mind is not an entirely accurate depiction of John Nash's life, it does offer an accurate representation of schizophrenia. Delusions of grandeur, or grandiose delusions, are among the most common signs of paranoid schizophrenia
