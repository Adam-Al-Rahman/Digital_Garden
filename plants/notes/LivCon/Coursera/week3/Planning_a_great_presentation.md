# Planning a Great Presentation


## Parts of a Presentation

### How should you organize it?

A well-organized presentation has three parts:

1. An introduction.
2. A body.
3. A conclusion.

### A presentation is like a hamburger.

It contains three parts:

1. Top bun
2. Meat and other fillings.
3. Bottom bun.

### Introduction

- Tells listeners what you're going to talk about.

It answer the question to the reader or listener,
- Why should I listen to this?

#### The introduction starts with a hook

It catches the listeners' interest. Like,
- Questioning
- Facts

### Body

#### The body of the presentation

- Ideas, details, examples
- They supports your main idea

If there's not enough support, listeners will lose interest.

### The conclusion

- Its summarizes your ideas.
- Makes your presentation feel finished.
- It's your last chance to make your point!

Without conclusion, the whole presentation falls apart!
