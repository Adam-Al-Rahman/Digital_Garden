## Presenting with a Slideshow

### Make your presentation great!

1. Making better slides.
2. Presenting more effectively with slides.

#### How to make better slides

- Plan your slides carefully.
- Keep your slides visually clean, simple, and clear.
- Avoid busy backgrounds
- Don't crowd your slides with too many words.
- It's better to add more slides.
- Choose colors carefully.

##### Think about fonts
- Simple and easy to read
- Big enough to read (28 point not pixel, 32 point)
- Don't use too many different fonts or color.

### Presenting more effectively with slides.

- Don't block the screen.
	- Th listeners need to see.
- Look at the listeners
	- They want to see your face, not your back.
- Don't just read the slides.
	- That can be very boring. A little bit of reading from a slide is all right, but reading everything is dull and unhelpful.
	- If you can give your whole talk just by reading from the slides, there's probably something wrong with the slides. `Too many words!`
