# Getting your Conversation Started

- Conversation in not a competitive sport. The goal is not to plow over everyone to get your point across or to dominate the conversation.
- An academic conversation should be team endeavor with
	- Equal Effort.
	- Even participation.
	- Collaborative attitude.

## Step for team conversation

- Settle in a position where all participants are able to see each other. Like a circle formation.
- Remove all unwanted thing that distract the conversation, like phone and laptop if not need.
- Introduce yourself.
	- One way to ask the name of your classmate is
		- "Hi, what's your name <u>again</u>?" with a friendly smile.
- Look at the discussion questions
	- All group member should agree on what topic to discuss, if not it is easy to off topic.
