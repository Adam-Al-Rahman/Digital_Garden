### INTRODUCTION

Hello everyone we are `Group-7` comprising Srajeta, Vishesh, Atiq, Priyanshu and myself Anushka . Our topic is `Future of Human Race`.

In Greek mythology, the phoenix lives a long life, exits spectacularly in flames, and then rises from the ashes of seemingly permanent death to live and flourish again.The bird represents life after death, rebirth and reinvention, or success from failure. Failure connotes fear of judgment, rejection, danger, embarrassment, and defeat. It may stall our progress, but it doesn’t necessarily block it permanently if learning from it helps us avoid similar pitfalls down the road. So, here we are the group Phoenix constantly learning from our mistakes and striving to achieve perfection.

Thinking about future can be an overwhelming and daunting endeavor yet it is one that challenges us to dream about technologies we believe will one day alter the fate of humanity.

Have you ever wondered what things will be like in next 25 or 50 years ?

In one sense , the future of humanity comprises everything that will ever happen to any human being.
Today, we can communicate with the internet via our computers and cell phones. But in the future the internet will be everywhere in wall screens, furniture , on billboards and even our glasses and contact lenses.

By mid-century , our world may be full of robots but we might not even notice them. That is because most robots probably won’t have human form.

By mid-century ,the full impact of a fossil fuel economy should be in full swing : global warming. According to UN’s Intergovernmental panel on climate change scientists have concluded with 90 percent confidence that global warming is driven by human activity.

Future of space travel:- 

- On a bright sunny day or an inky black night , we all wonder sometimes : what’s out there , out of sight?
- Beyond Earth’s friendly confines, an entire universe awaits our exploration.
- By 2100, humanity will be on the brink of a new era of space exploration as we send satellites to locate earth like twins in space , explore the moons of Jupiter.
- One of the most stunning achievements of space program has been the robotic exploration of outer space , which has greatly expanded the horizon of humanity.
- Foremost among these robotic mission is  the search for earth-like planets in space that can harbour life. So far, ground based telescopes have identified about 3,800 planets orbiting in distant star systems, and new planets are being discovered at the rate of one planet every one to two weeks.

### Extinction Of Human Beings

Hello everyone  my name is Priyanshu choudhary. according to me there are 3 possible reasons that can lead to extinction of human beings.
first World war 3
As we all know that world war 3 is going to be a nuclear war.nuclear war, which history and popular culture have etched onto our minds as one of the biggest potential risks to human survival. Our vulnerability to this threat grows if countries produce highly-enriched uranium, and as political tensions between nations escalate. That vulnerability determines our exposure. 

As is the case for all existential risks, there aren't hard estimates available on how much of Earth's population a nuclear firestorm might eliminate. But it is expected that 80% population will be eliminate by this and rest will be eliminated by its after effect like food crises, different viruses , changes in climate which will be not suitable for humans

second reason is PANDEMIC 
The misuse of biotechnology is another existential risk that keeps researchers up at night. This is technology that harnesses biology to make new products. One in particular concerns Cassidy Nelson: the abuse of biotechnology to engineer deadly, quick-spreading pathogens. "I worry about a whole range of different pandemic scenarios. But I do think the ones that could be man-made are possibly the greatest threat we could have from biology this century," she said. we can take the example of corona virus and how much damage its has cause to the entire world and the damage it has cause to economy which is now also leading in death of people due to hunger.

Third reason is CLIMAT CHANGE
 A tour of the threats to human survival can hardly exclude climate change, a phenomenon that's already driving the decline and extinction of multiple species across the planet. Could it hurl humanity toward the same fate?

The accompaniments to climate change — food insecurity, water scarcity, and extreme weather events — are set to increasingly threaten human survival, at regional scales. But looking to the future, climate change is also what Kemp described as an "existential risk multiplier" at global scales, meaning that it amplifies other threats to humanity's survival. "It does appear to have all these relationships to both conflict as well as political change, which just makes the world a much more dangerous place to be." Imagine: food or water scarcity intensifying international tensions, and triggering nuclear wars with potentially enormous human fatalities
 This way of thinking about extinction highlights the interconnectedness of existential risks. As Kemp hinted before, it's unlikely that a mass extinction event would result from a single calamity like a nuclear war or pandemic. Rather, history shows us that most civilizational collapses are driven by several interwoven factors. And extinction as we typically imagine it — the rapid annihilation of everyone on Earth — is just one way it could play out. 

A catastrophic event might leave only a few hundred or thousand survivors on Earth, which would bring humanity's viability, as a species, into question. Alternatively, a collapse could wipe out only a segment of humanity, but consequently trigger global insecurity and conflict, reduce our resilience to other threats, setting in motion a more gradual decline. "We're not talking about a single idea of what an extinction would look like, or how it would unfold. It's more nuanced than that," Kemp explained.

### Colonizing Other Planet

The idea of colonizing other planet likely appeals to a small fraction of humankind. To date, no space colony has been set up.

Geologist Stephen Gillett suggested in 1996 that this could make Mercury an ideal place to build and launch Solar Sail Space Craft. It is estimated that the pole of mercury contain adequate amount of water, likely covered with hydrocarbon. This would make agriculture possible.

Venus is the second largest terrestrial planet. It is easier to colonize Venus comparison to other planets. For starter, the technology needed to colonize the atmosphere of Venus because it has a thicker atmosphere, can better protect humans from radiations coming into contact with the surface of planet. Additionally, Venus has an immense buildup of carbon dioxide inside its atmosphere which in the future may be a resource we can use to extract oxygen from.

Christian Dominion theology drives colonization advocates to declare that humans must colonize Mars. The hypothetical colonization of Mars has received interest from public space agencies and private corporations. Mars can be colonized by human by the year 2050, as long as autonomous mining processes quickly become more commercially viable. The process of having human on Mars will be to set up operations, go there and produce water with robot first and then be able to extract the hydrogen to make the energy ready before people arrive.

With the help of colonization we can also communicate with the Alien species. We use a language of spoken and written words, of course, but aliens might use numbers, shapes, tones or something beyond our imagination. Will we know how to respond to them and what to say? There are some possibilities that an Alien communication could take place. The first possibility is that the message could be written in the declarative- transactional language that we understand. However, unlikely alien counterparts could primarily communicate through something like smell and their signals are meant to be run into something like an olfactory TV set. For Olfactory communicator, this could be the most logical way to communicate over long distance.

### Space Colonization

Space colonization, the establishment of permanent human habitats beyond Earth, has been the object of both popular speculation and scientific inquiry for decades. 
The idea of space colonization has an almost poetic quality: 
- Space is the next great frontier, the next great leap for humankind, that we hope to eventually conquer through our force of will and our ingenuity. From a more prosaic point of view, space colonization is important because it represents a long-term survival strategy for humankind1 . Space colonization is tremendously important for the future of humankind in two ways. 
- First, space colonization means that the total future number of humans who will exist and whose lives will be worth living could be orders of magnitude greater than today . 
- By colonizing space, humankind could therefore create a future that is generally morally desirable: 
	- There could be vastly more people to enjoy vastly more life-years worth living if we succeed in colonizing space. Second, engaging in space colonization represents a strategy for mitigating existential risks. Existential risks are risks that could result in the extinction of humankind or in the permanent curtailing of humankind’s potential for future development . In a more technical sense, existential risks can be thought of as risks that could cause the permanent loss of a large fraction of humankind’s future moral expected value : If humankind goes extinct or stagnates prematurely, the majority of humankind’s positive future value (the many thousands of generations and many billions of people who could lead lives worth living) would be lost. Mitigating existential risks is therefore a moral priority, even though the current generation of humans and other sentient beings might not be affected by them in their own lifetimes. We do not know when, or if at all, humankind will achieve the technological capability for creating permanent habitats beyond Earth. But if space colonization were merely uncertain in this manner, humankind should still push for space colonization as much and as fast as possible, since the added value of achieving space colonization capabilities sooner rather than later would be big, and the added value of increasing the overall probability of achieving space colonization capabilities at all would be immense. But space colonization is not just uncertain. It is also risky. Engaging in space colonization and eventually colonizing space can exacerbate existing risks and it can create new ones. The risks so exacerbated and created could create a lot of moral disvalue by removing happiness and by creating suffering — in some scenarios so much so that the overall benefit of colonizing space could end up being smaller than the damage caused by it.

### Artificial Intelligence

**Artificial Intelligence (AI) refer to any technique that enables computers or robot to mimic or act and think like human.**

### From where the term Artificial Intelligence comes

`John McCarthy (1927-2011)`, an American computer scientist coined the term `artificial intelligence`. In fact, he was one of the founders of the discipline of AI.

McCarthy received the `Turing Award` for his contributions to the topic of artificial intelligence. He also received the `Kyoto Prize` and the `United States National Medal of Science`.

In a 1979 article titled `Ascribing Mental Qualities to Machines` McCarthy wrote:

> “Machines as simple as thermostats can be said to have beliefs, and having beliefs seems to be a characteristic of most machines capable of problem-solving performance.”

#### How will robot communicate with human?


Sophia

The first AI robot to receive citizenship of a country. She became a citizen of Saudi Arabia in 2017.

In November 2017, Sophia was named the united nation s development programme's first ever innovation champion.

Sophia was activated on February 14, 2016 by Hong Kong based  company Hanson Robotics

Sophia is a robot she can communicate with human and can give human like face expression.
