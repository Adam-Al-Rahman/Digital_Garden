### Summary

The story begins in a courtroom where a teenage boy is on trial for stabbing his father to death. The judge instructs the jury to discuss and decided wheather the boy is guilty of murder or not. And if he is guilty he is sentence to death.
In the discussion room all jury except Juror Number 8 (K.K. Raina) were decided that the boy is guilty. But K.K Raina was not.

From here onwards K.K Raina makes the other jurors to rethink their decision and evaluate the decision based on the correct evidence.


### Description

One by one the K.K Raina makes valid point and pin-point the situation, what happend at that night in the boy's house. While he does that few other juror started taking his side, because of his valid point.

- The point that made impact on me was when K.K Raina explain how the old man comes out of his room and go to stares in 15 seconds. Which was not possible for that old man in his condition to cover 10 + 40 feets using a stick.

The Boy's Situation was:

- 19 year boy.
- born in slum area.
- Stabbed 4 inch in his father's chest.
- Boy was watching a movie when his father was killed.
- Killed at 12:10


### Analysis

The movies is well done in cinematography, editing, mise-en-scene, lighting, diegetic and non-diegetic sound and narrating.
- There are some stop or glitches in the movies other than that it's very well done.


### Conclusion | Evaluation

This movie is excellent is the case of evaluation, as like to point, K.K Raina as juror who thought the case logically and took the decision only on the bases of correct evidence. And made other to re-think their decision.
- At the end the boy was found `not guilty` from jury.


### What I Learned 
Before making any decision we should evaluate and research the point on what bases we are making those point and then take a decision. And should not follow the Bandwagon fallacy.
- Do not make a decision emotionally.
