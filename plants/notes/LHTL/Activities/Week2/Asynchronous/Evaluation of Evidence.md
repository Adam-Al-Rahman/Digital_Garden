### Summary

The begins a courtroom where a teenage boy in on trial for stabbing his father to death. The judges instructs  the jury to discuss and decided wheather the boy is guilty of murder or not. And if he is guilty he is sentence to death.
In the discussion room all jury except Juror Number 8 (K.K. Raina) were decided that the boy is guilty. But K.K Raina was not.

From here onwards K.K Raina makes the other jurors to rethink their decision and evaluate the decision based on the correct evidence.


### Description

One by one the K.K Raina makes valid point and pin-point the situation, what happend at that night in the boy's house. While he does that few other juror started taking side of K.K Raina, because of his valid point.

- The point that make me head out is when K.K Raina explain how the old man comes out of his room and go to stares in 15. Which was not possible for a old man to cover 10 + 40 feets whose is walking using a stick.

### Analysis

The movies is well done in cinematography, editing, mise-en-sc√®ne, lighting, diegetic and non-diegetic sound and narrating.
- There are some stop in the movies other than that it's very well done.


### Conclusion | Evaluation


- 19 year boy.
- born in slum area.
- stabbed 4 inch in his chest
- boy was watching a movie when his father was dead.
- Killed at 12:10

### What I Learned 
Before making any decision we should evaluate and research the point on what bases we are making those point and then take a decision. And should not follow the Bandwagon fallcy.
