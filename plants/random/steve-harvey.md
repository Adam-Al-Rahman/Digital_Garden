## Why do you like the video, in term of leadership analysis?

In the video `Steve Harvey` motivate people to be a leader by saying:

- How a leader is maid and not born?

> You can be a leader, but a leader is a developed set of skill.

- What stop the an average person from being a leader?

> It is the fear of the consequences of leading
> > Most people don't want the responsibility of being a leader.

- Consequences of being a follower

> The responsibility and ramifications and consequences of being a follower is dire, more dire and more severe.
> > Because, now as a follower you just got to along with whatever and need to make some adjustments.
